# Pytorchsimplified
The Colab file is list of Pytorch like APIs , simple, easy to understand , and written from scratch in Python for beginners 
I have compiled this file after getting inspiration from Andrej Karpathy nn zero to hero videos. I have added some more Pytorch like APIs that we often use while doing ML/DL workflow. 
Pytorch documentations can be sometimes daunting for beginner to understand , and the same time it is very essential to undertand what goes under the hood of torch.nn.Moduel.
This file gives simple and easy to understand explanation of all the Pytorch APIs that are commonly used in model building , training and evalaution.
