# Pytorchsimplified
While starting my journey of learning, I realised Pytorch documentations can be sometimes daunting for beginner to understand.
At the same time it is very essential to undertand what goes under the hood of torch.nn.Moduel. It gives us solid foundation as well as intution of how the code is working.
The Colab file is list of Pytorch like APIs , simple, easy to understand , and written from scratch in Python for beginners. 
I have compiled this file after getting inspiration from Andrej Karpathy nn zero to hero videos. I have added some more Pytorch like APIs along with what we were taught in deep learning lecture series by andrej karpathy(NN: Zero to Hero),  that we often use while doing ML/DL workflow. I will keep updating this file so that this could be a directory for Pytorch beginners along with Pytorch official tutorials. 
This file gives simple and easy to understand explanation of all the Pytorch APIs that are commonly used in model building , training and evalaution. 
It is essential to understand the Pytorch abstraction  as it helps in debugging codes faster while building models using pytorch framework
